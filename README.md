Remake of a car-rental agency for training purposes on AJAX requests. Uses jQuery and PHP.

## Training purpose Website 

Realised during the Webforce3 course, in order to work on AJAX requests. Each participant had to choose a car renter and recreate its website. The aim was to refresh our skills in jQuery and introduce get/post requests in AJAX and APIs.
